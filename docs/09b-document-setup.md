The document has unnecessary text at the beginning and end and a hard paragraph return at the
end of every line. These all need to be removed.

Make sure you get the hard paragraph returns removed first.

## Task 3.01 Delete Front Matter

*Delete unnecessary front matter*

Delete everything in the downloaded text up to the title. Your new document should begin with the title of the work.

[Watch the Video Tutorial for deleting the front matter; Life of the Bee (19 seconds)](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2017_fall/inls161_001/videos/markup/markup-02-delete-front-matter.mp4)

## Task 3.02 Delete End Matter

*Delete unnecessary end matter*

Using your find tool, search for END OF THIS PROJECT and find the line that looks like this:

<code>END OF THIS</code>

If that does not work, try:

<code>*** END</code>

If that does not work, scroll to the end and then scroll back up to locate the start of the end matter.

Delete that line and all the remaining lines of the document. Your new document should end with the last line of the original work and should not include any of the Project Gutenberg legalese that one normally finds at the end.

## Task 3.03 Remove extra ^p Markers

*Turn on your paragraph markers to see them:*

*Next:Eliminate unnecessary paragraph markers*

Using your find and replace tools, reformat the e-book to eliminate unnecessary paragraph markers and to permit the text to wrap until it hits an actual paragraph mark.

*The Video makes reference to the slide show below as being on an Exercise 1 page. That page was confusing, and has been deleted. The link to the mentioned slide show is directly below this line.*

## Task 3.04 Page Setup

Mac Users: The most frustrating part of this project for Mac Users is the setup because the user interface is very different from the PC demonstration. If you are Mac User [watch this video for set up](hhttps://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=006426fe-d9b2-4199-b61f-acef01580330) and not try to follow along with the PC demo in class or the setup videos here.

If you wish to use other dimensions, explain your decision in a footnote.

* .3 inch margins left and right;
