## Filter: single level

1. Filter the data on the```17-Filter Disabled Workers``` worksheet to find the **bottom three Congressional Districts** in terms of **Disabled Workers**
2. Do not sort the results. Simply show the results of filtering out all but the bottom three districts.

2. had an **above average ResidentialCustomerCount**

## Pivot Table

Too much detail on this page to condense here so here is the link to the [Pivot Table Task on Class Web Page](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2020_spring/inls161_001/13b.03.pivot-tables.html)

Here is [video from Zoom Class Spring 2020](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/task04-videos/pivot-table-video.mp4) *This video is the same as this semester.*

Optional videos: These are supplemental videos that were used in past classes. Concepts are similar, but the data is different.
