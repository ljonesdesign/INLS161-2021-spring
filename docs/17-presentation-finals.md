The exam session will be used to view your classmate's presentations. This is a valuable class for solidifying
your presentation skills.

There is no additional work necessary for the final exam period. Attendance will be taken for the final exam for UNC administration purposes. If you are unable to attend any exam due to your schedule, please contact me prior the end of the semester.

If you are not able to attend your scheduled exam, you may attend an alternate session.
