## Introductions

We will spend some time today to get to know each other.

## First tool: Browser

The recommended browser for Sakai is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is also a good choice. You will need a web browser for testing your website; either of these will work just fine. Avoid using Mac specific (Safari) or Windows specific (Edge or Explorer) browsers as a primary testing tool for web development. Before your Friday morning recitation, start out class by logging into Sakai: <https://sakai.unc.edu/welcome/>

## Sakai

Take a look at the navigation items in the left side bar:

**Calendar:** This is where you can find the links for zoom meetings throughout the semester. These may be updated for our recitations.

**Home Page and Schedule:** This is the INLS 161 Companion Website. It is embedded in the Sakai Site, but you can navigate to it at this link outside of Sakai. You may want to bookmark this site in your browser: <https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/>

**Syllabus:** Read over this on your own before the upcoming lecture this week.

**Lessons:** When you click on the Lessons Link you will see Tasks listed with leading zeros:

* Task 01.01 Introduction on Forum
* Task 01.02 Newletter Signup
* Task 01.03 VPN Setup
* etc.

> **These tasks will be our main focus in the recitations**. You should look at the Lessons page before each recitation and be aware of the tasks we are planning to work on for that day.

**Assignments:** This is where you submit your work. Pay attention to the due dates. It is important for you not to fall behind or you will get overwhelmed with a backlog of work. **If you attend the recitations, you will most likely be able to keep up with your work.**



## Forum Posts
VALUE ADDED ITEM | .5 each

**Forum posts 1-8:** You do not have to submit forum postings in the Assignment Section. Just put your forum post in the appropriate folder for your section. I will find and grade your posts from the forum.

:::tip
The folder is labeled with the forum number and your name is always next to your post title. Therefore, from an information sharing standpoint, including your name and forum post number in the title is not necessary and it obfuscates what the reader most needs&mdash;the title.

## Comment on Peer's post
VALUE ADDED ITEM | 3 points

In Figure 1 above notice the black triangle to the left of the Post Title. This indicates that there is at least one comment on that post. **You should make at least one comment on a peer's post sometime this semester.**  There is no need to submit this in the assignment section. I will find your comments and grade them in the process of reading the forums.

## Starter
VALUE ADDED ITEM | 3 points

During the semester I will ask each of you to present one of your forum posts at the start of each class. Some of you will need to step up and get this done early and others will need to present at later dates. A starter has a chain of prerequisites that are not very time consuming, but they have to be done in this order:

1. You need to subscribe to a tech newsletter
2. You need to get a newsletter in your inbox
3. You need to scan over some articles
4. Choose to read one article that catches your attention
5. This is not a formal report. You do not have to summarize the article. Some of the articles can be rather long. Write a short forum post on why you find this article interesting and how it relates to your interests, or passions, or concerns.

### Why we do this:

#### Big Payoff

You at a job interview:

> **Interviewer:** How do you keep up with technology?

> **You:** I subscribe to MIT Technology Review.

> **Interviewer:** What is something that you found interesting?

> **You:** (thinking over your posts...) Google Achieving Quantum Supremacy.....

#### Other Things

Or maybe you notice something that inspires you to build a project, or pursue a particular job, or an advanced degree.

## Professionalism
VALUE ADDED ITEM | 5.5 points

[Characteristics of Professionalism](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/characteristics-professionalism-1209.html)

View these points as a gift&mdash;5.5 points earned for doing what should expected.

Everything in this class is about empowering you to meet the complex demands of these very challenging times. It is my desire to treat students positively, as much as possible, and be corrective and not punitive.  I am pleased to say that it is very rare for UNC students to miss out on any professionalism points.

The [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.unc.edu/honor-system) issues a NG (no grade) when a permanent grade is pending a judicial review by the Honor Court; therefore, all earned points can be viewed as professionalism grades in this situation.
