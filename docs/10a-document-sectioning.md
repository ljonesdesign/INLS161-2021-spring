## Task 3.13 Section Breaks

Insert appropriate section breaks so that each separate element of the
work (preface, chapters, endnotes, if any) starts on new page. (Use your document map and your keyboard shortcuts to speed the process).

## Task 3.14 Delete ToC

If your downloaded book has a table of contents included in it, delete it because you will replace it with a new Table of Contents.

## Task 3.15 Create ToC Page

After the title page and prior to the first section of the book, add a section break that will make the following page start on new page between the title page and the first chapter and put the words "**Table of Contents**" formatted as a Heading 3 atop this page. Do not try to create your table of contents yet!
