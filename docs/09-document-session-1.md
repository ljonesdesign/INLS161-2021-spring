This recitation is a blended session. I will demonstrate all of the activities on a PC because the PC version of Word is what most of you will encounter in the business world.

This session is geared towards helping you get your project done. The lecture provides the context about why you are doing what you are doing.

Long ago I decided to demonstrate this project using [The Children's Life of the Bee](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516), so I will continue this tradition. Dr. Bergquist will teach about document markup using various other book examples in the lecture. You should not turn in our example projects used in our online teaching materials. If you have any question about your book, you should check in with me.

You are going to need to [choose a book](http://www.gutenberg.org). If you choose from any of the most recent 1000 books below, you will be assured that no previous student has ever submitted a book from that list. Be sure to understand that it is a violation of the UNC Honor Code to submit any duplicate project file that has been previously completed and submitted in any previous INLS 161 course or recitation. I trust that all students are honorable and will have fun with formatting their own book.

[Project Gutenberg Newest Releases](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=release_date) Here is a list of the latest 1,000 recent additions. It's kind of fascinating to see what volunteers have been working on over the last six months. Find anything that you like but you should **not go for books with fewer that 8 chapters or more than 15 chapters** and stay away from oddly formatted text or poetry. You want clean blocks of text; You will not attempt to include any graphics or photos from the book, so you should stay away from books that are mostly graphically in nature. It is okay to choose a book with some photos, but the text format you choose will not have the photos included.

## New Macintosh Setup Videos
The most frustrating part of this project for Mac Users is the setup because the user interface is very different from the PC demonstration. If you are Mac User you should [watch this video for set up](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/task03-mac-video/macsetup.mp4) and not try to follow along with the PC demo in class.

## Videos from Previous Class
 In the left side bar is an entire course of video lessons for this project. It would be a good plan to get ahead and try to complete all of these tasks before our final documents class. Then we can focus on getting the difficult parts corrected.
 You are welcome to use a grade sheet that is number referenced to these video lectures or the grade sheet without number references.
