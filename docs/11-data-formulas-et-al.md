This is a University Holiday. We will not meet today. Follow these directions and you can get started on the project

You will work through the steps here: <https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.01.formatting.html> and the steps to the other links at the bottom of that page.

Go to that page and download the source workbook or, you can [download sourcefile here (same link)](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/c133eae3-71e7-47b0-be54-567e2a25f167/materials/04/task04.datasets.xlsx).

After you download it, do not updated it or enable links because the file is linked to other files you do not have access to. However, you will need need to allow editing. You will make edits to this file and submit your edits for final grading at the end of the data session.

Here is a video from Fall 2020 that will show you how to do all of the steps on the project:
