You will work through the steps here: <https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.01.formatting.html> and the steps to the other links at the bottom of that page.

Go to that page and download the source workbook or, you can [download soucefile here (same link)](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/c133eae3-71e7-47b0-be54-567e2a25f167/materials/04/task04.datasets.xlsx).

After you download it, do not updated it or enable links because the file is linked to other files you do not have access to. However, you will need need to allow editing. You will make edits to this file and submit your edits for final grading at the end of the data session.
