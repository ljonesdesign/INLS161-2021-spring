This is a University Holiday. We will not meet today. Read everything on this page and you will be able to get started on the project at any time before or after your scheduled recitation time.  I will offer flexible Zoom office hours if you need additional help; contact me at lbjones[@]unc.edu to schedule.

Below is a video from Fall 2020 that will show you how to do all of the Intro Session 04 Tasks. There may be some minor differences in worksheet names or numbers, but I think all of the basic material is the same. If you encounter any confusion, let me know via email. Go to the [setting up a worksheet page](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.01.formatting.html) and download the source workbook or, you can [download the sourcefile here (same link)](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/c133eae3-71e7-47b0-be54-567e2a25f167/materials/04/task04.datasets.xlsx).

After you download it, do not update it, or enable links, because the file is linked to other files you do not have access to. However, you will need to allow editing. You will make edits to this file and submit your edits for final grading at the end of the data sessions. There is only one submisson at the end, so make sure you do not fall behind over the next few weeks.

:::note
It may not be necessary to use the password to download the source file. I think you only need to log into Sakai to get the download. If so, ignore the first minute of the video that talks about how to get the file via password.
