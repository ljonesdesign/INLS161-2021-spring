This is a University Holiday. We will not meet today. Follow these directions and you can get started on the project.

You will work through the steps on the [class website recitation page here](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.01.formatting.html), and the steps to the other links at the bottom of that page.

## week of 30 March 4.0 Recitation Tasks

:::tip Links to Required Tasks [setting up a worksheet](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.01.formatting.html) | [setting up a workbook](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.02.workbook.html) | [other tools](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.03.other-tools.html) | [functions, formulas, formatting](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11b.04.formulas.html)
:::

Go to that page and download the source workbook or, you can [download the sourcefile here (same link)](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/c133eae3-71e7-47b0-be54-567e2a25f167/materials/04/task04.datasets.xlsx).

:::note
It may not be necessary to use the password to download the source file. I think you only need to log into Sakai to get the download. If so, ignore the first minute of the video that talks about how to get the file via password.
:::

After you download it, do not update it, or enable links, because the file is linked to other files you do not have access to. However, you will need to allow editing. You will make edits to this file and submit your edits for final grading at the end of the data sessions. There is only one submisson at the end, so make sure you do not fall behind over the next few weeks.

Here is a video from Fall 2020 that will show you how to do all of the Intro Session 04 Task. There may be some minor differences in worksheet names or numbers, but I think all of the basic material is the same. If you encounter any confusion, let me know via email.
