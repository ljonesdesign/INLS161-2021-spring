## Panopto Update
I discovered at the very end of last semester that private one-to-one Panopto feedback videos were **extremely** effective. It's like office hours without having to set times. It's super flexible. So I want to spend a little bit of time demonstrating the Panopto interface and make sure you all know how to login here [https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/](https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com) and see your shared folders.

## Recommended SFTP Programs

Use any SFTP you like. Here are my personal preferences for teaching:

**PC:** I like WinSCP for Windows because it is free and Open Source shareware, and has no adware. You can [download WinSCP with this link](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). *Don't click the "get it with from Microsoft" link unless you want to help fund the open source project by paying $10.* 

> There is no registration code to enter for this package, and it does not have an ending trial period.

**Mac:** I like Fetch for the Mac because UNC has a Use License and I have a lot of experience with using it for teaching. Here is the [UNC Software download link for Fetch](https://software.sites.unc.edu/fetch-download/). Make sure to look for this:

**Serial Number Name:** The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

**Serial Number:** (The download page will show you the Serial number) 

> It is long and hard to type, so copy-paste into Fetch.

[Here is a link to a Fetch Presentation on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QGQjVMvFS3-lIgMI4BoESXnRnmit-cV2_5p-5dYlFhU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Recommended Editor

Use any Editor you like. My personal preference for teaching for both **PC and Mac** is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
