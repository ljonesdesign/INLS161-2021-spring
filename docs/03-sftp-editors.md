## Recommended SFTP Programs and Editor

Use any SFTP or text editor you like. Here are my personal preferences for teaching:

**PC:** I like WinSCP for Windows because it is free and Open Source shareware, and it does not have any adware. You can [download WinSCP with this link](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). *Don't click the "get it with from Microsoft" link unless you want to help fund the open source project by paying $10.*

**Mac:** I like Fetch for the Mac because UNC has a Use License and I have a lot of experience with using it for teaching.  Here is the [download link for Fetch](https://software.sites.unc.edu/fetch-download/) 

## Recommended Editor

**PC and Mac:** [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
