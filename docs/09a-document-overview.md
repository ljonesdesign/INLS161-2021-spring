## Mac Help

[Macintosh help files for the setup section](https://github.com/lblakej/document-markup-mac-help/blob/master/docs-mac-project-part-1/README.md) *Mac Help is additional information to help Mac Users with the differences in Word Mac and Word for Windows. Mac Users should not depend 100% on following the steps in the mac help sections. Check your work against the steps in this page and the following pages, and use the grade sheet for a final check.*

Mac Users will benefit from watching the videos; the process is very similar on the mac in most cases.

It is best to follow all of these steps in order!

Your task is to transform, through skillful formatting, a basic text version of the book into one created to be capable of being saved as a file capable of being read on an e-reader.

This tutorial demo uses the children's version of the book [Life of the Bee](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516).

If you decide to follow this tutorial in its entirety, you WILL NOT be able to submit **Life of the Bee** for your Task 03 project. You must use your book. Do not submit Life of the Bee.

It is not bad practice to follow the entire tutorial if you have time, but you can most-likely follow the directions using your book's file.

Find and download your book's UTF-8 file, or navigate to [Life of the Bee's Gutenberg location](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516) and download the plain text version, in UTF-8 format, with no compression and a size of 164 kB, from the main site. Save the document on your client as a .txt file. Once you have the document on your client, open it in the program of your choice and save it in the program's file extension, (.docx for Microsoft Word) so you can take advantage  of the specific tools available in the program.

Here is a link to the contents of a [scanned copy of Children's Life of the Bee](https://archive.org/stream/childrenslifeofb00maet2#page/n11/mode/2up).

This is at archive.org, not Project Gutenberg. Take notice of all the chapter start pages. Are they all odd or even? Keep this in mind when you decide which section break you are to use, when asked to set section breaks. This is a standard publishing convention, so you should follow this section break-style for your book.
