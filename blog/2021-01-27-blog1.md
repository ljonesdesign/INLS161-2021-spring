File names with umlauts, accents, etc, can cause issues on older systems. They should work fine on newer systems that are up-to-date.
The safest approach is to completely avoid using special characters.

Generally, I donâ€™t use any characters for file naming outside of these: numbers, lowercase english characters, hypen ```-```, and sometimes an underscore ```_```
I avoid using the period except for the file extension. I always use hypens unless I must use underscores. (Some database systems will only allow underscores.)

```1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz - _ .```
 
Here is a nice overview from the [Pan Health Organization on file naming](https://www.paho.org/par/index.php?option=com_docman&view=download&alias=560-guide-to-proper-file-naming&category_slug=organizacion-de-la-representacion&Itemid=253). (They obviously must deal with multiple character sets all the time).
